<h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3><!--

Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a
href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a
href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a
href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>.  For MIT
Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the
secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a>.

<p>

Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:

<dl>
  <dt> <i>Will there be a fourth edition?  If so, when will it be available?</i>

  <dd> We are currently working on the fourth edition.  No public
       release date has been set.  If you're wondering whether to hold
       off buying the third edition in anticipation of the fourth
       edition, I advise you not to wait.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Where is the website for the book?</i>
  <dd> The MIT Press site is <a
       href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms">http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
  <dd> We maintain an <a href="clrs-bugs">errata page</a> that allows
       you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer.
       There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list
       only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>How do I report errors?</i>
  <dd> First, please visit the <a href="clrs-bugs">errata page</a>
       to verify that the error has not been reported already.  Once
       you have determined that you have found an unreported error,
       send email to <a
href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>.  We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
  <dd> Yes.  Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections
       to all errors that have been reported by that time.  The <a
       href="clrs-bugs">errata page</a> indicates in which printing
       each error was corrected.
       </p>
			 
			 <p>Because we are intensively working on the fourth edition, I
			 am no longer posting errors in the third edition.
			 </p>


  <dt> <i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
  <dd> Each edition is a major revision of the book.  The first edition
       of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was published in 1990, the
       second edition came out in 2001, and the third edition appeared
       in 2009.  A printing for a
       given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more
       copies.  As the answer to the previous question indicates, we
       have been correcting errors in each printing of the second
       and third
       editions.  We perturb the pagination as little as possible when
       correcting errors for a new printing.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name="solutions"></a><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and
       problems?</i>       
  <dd> As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for
       a select set of exercises and problems.  They are posted at the <a
       href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms">MIT Press website</a>.
       
       <p>

       We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available
       only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use.
       The manual has lecture notes and solutions
       to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of
       them.  (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and
       problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.)
       You'll need to contact the MIT Press
       for passwords to access the manual site and the files.
       (Contact information is at the <a
       href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms">MIT Press
       website</a>.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any
       of my coauthors.

       <p>

       <strong>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for
       solutions.</strong>

       <p>

  <dt> <i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode
       in the book?</i>
  <dd> I created two packages for LaTeX2e.  The <code>clrscode</code>
       package gives you pseudocode in the style of the second edition,
       and the <code>clrscode3e</code> package gives you pseudocode in
       the style of the third edition.  You can download either
       package and its documentation by clicking <a
       href="clrscode">here</a>.  The <code>clrscode</code> package is
       also on the
       <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/&preferredCTAN=tug.ctan.org&action=/tools/filesearch&catstring=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/">CTAN website</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Can you send me a free copy of the book?  Can you send me
       an electronic copy of the book?  Can you help me with this
       algorithms problem I have?</i>
  <dd> No, no, and sorry, but no.  You can purchase an electronic copy
       of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a version of
       <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> for Kindle.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition,
       one published by the MIT Press and one published by McGraw-Hill.
       How do the two versions differ?</i>
  <dd> Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content
       in the two versions is identical.  McGraw-Hill also includes a CD
       (see the next question).
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming
       language, rather than just pseudocode?</i>
  <dd> In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD
       containing Java implementations of all the algorithms in Parts
       I-VI.  The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that
       document all the classes.
       We did not update the Java implementations for the third
       edition.  <p>

       For the fourth edition, we will make available on the MIT Press
       website implementations in Python by Linda Xiao.

My wife, Nicole, and I took a <a href="bbqtour">Barbecue tour</a> of
the South in August 1998.

<p>

In July 2010, I rollerbladed the <a
href="https://friendsofcdatrails.org/trail-of-the-coeur-dalenes/">Trail
of the Coeur D'Alenes</a>, a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in the
Idaho panhandle.  Accompanied by my friend, Paul Daro, who also
bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42 miles the first day and the
balance the second day.  Here is a <a
href="images/Plummer.jpg">photo</a> of the three of us at the start of
the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the
Coeur D'Alene reservation) and here is a <a
href="images/Mullan.jpg">photo</a> of Paul and me at the start of the
second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan, Idaho.  We met <a
href="images/CDA-moose.jpg">this fellow</a> on the trail during the
first day.  <a href="CDA.html">This page</a> has some rough videos
that Paul took.

<p>

I was the Ice Man for the <a href="http://www.mdbbq.com">Maryland
State Barbecue Championship</a> in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Here's a <a
href="ICE.jpg">photo</a> from the 2005 contest of me with a
quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice.  The photo was taken by the
<a href="http://www.dizzypigbbq.com/">Dizzy Pigs</a>, the 2005 and
2006 Grand Champions.  Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by
the end of the second day.  The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other
contestants, can explain why.

<p>

I was <a href="http://www.kcbs.us">Kansas City Barbeque Society</a>
Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145.  (I have purposely let my KCBS
membership lapse.)  My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011
Maryland State Championship in Bel Air.  <a
href="images/Judging%20chicken.JPG">Here</a> is a photo of me just
starting to judge the first item, chicken.  And <a
href="images/After%20judging.JPG">here</a> is a photo after judging
five entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket.

And In Charge," the contest organizer.)

<p>

In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the
4000-foot peaks in the <a href="http://hikethewhites.com/">White
Mountains</a> of New Hampshire.
